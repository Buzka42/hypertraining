    'home.scientific.title': 'Maximize Your Gains: The Science Behind Why a Personal Trainer is Essential for RIR Accuracy',
    'home.scientific.description': 'Understanding Reps in Reserve (RIR) and its critical importance for maximizing hypertrophic gains. See how inaccurate RIR estimation can lead to leaving potential gains on the table.',
    
    // Scientific RIR section content
    'home.scientific.intro.title': 'RIR (Reps in Reserve)',
    'home.scientific.intro.1': 'RIR (Reps in Reserve) is a critical metric in resistance training that measures how many additional repetitions you could perform before reaching muscular failure. For meaningful muscle hypertrophy, training with low RIR (e.g., 0-4 RIR) is essential. This ensures you work close enough to your maximum capacity to effectively stimulate muscle growth.',
    'home.scientific.novice.title': 'The Novice\'s Dilemma',
    'home.scientific.novice.1': 'Untrained and novice individuals consistently underestimate their true RIR, meaning they often end sets far from failure, leaving significant muscle gains on the table. Research consistently shows this pattern across different populations.',
    'home.scientific.novice.2': 'A key meta-analysis by Halperin et al. (2021) and similar studies prove that novices often misjudge RIR by 2-4 repetitions, believing they are close to failure while they still have many reps in reserve. This leads to suboptimal training intensity and slower progress. When individuals train alone, they often end sets prematurely, significantly limiting their muscle growth potential.',
    'home.scientific.trainer.title': 'The Role of a Personal Trainer',
    'home.scientific.trainer.1': 'A personal trainer can accurately assess RIR, provide objective feedback, and safely push clients to the optimal intensity needed for growth. This objective feedback is invaluable for muscle gains as it eliminates the guesswork that often plagues self-directed training.',
    'home.scientific.trainer.2': 'Trainers provide progressive overload and proper RIR application across different exercises, adapting to each client\'s unique capabilities and daily performance fluctuations. This knowledge is particularly crucial for novices who lack the experience to accurately judge their own limits.',
    'home.scientific.science.title': 'RIR Science and Hypertrophy',
    'home.scientific.science.1': 'Accurate RIR application, facilitated by a trainer, directly translates to significantly better muscle hypertrophy and strength outcomes. The scientific evidence is clear: training closer to failure (lower RIR) produces better results.',
    'home.scientific.science.2': 'A meta-regression published in Sports Medicine in 2021 showed that training closer to failure (lower RIR) is directly associated with greater muscle hypertrophy. While exact percentages vary by individual, these studies confirm the dose-response relationship between effort and muscle growth. The closer you train to your true limit, the greater the stimulus for muscle growth.',
    'home.scientific.conclusion': 'The evidence is clear: working with a qualified personal trainer who understands RIR can significantly improve your muscle-building results by ensuring you train at the optimal intensity. Do not leave your gains on the table - let a professional guide you to your true potential.',

    // Scientific RIR section content
    'home.scientific.intro.title': 'RIR (Powtórzenia w Zapasie)',
    'home.scientific.intro.1': 'RIR (Reps in Reserve) to krytyczna metryka w treningu oporowym, która mierzy, ile dodatkowych powtórzeń mógłbyś wykonać przed osiągnięciem upadku mięśniowego. Dla znaczącej hipertrofii mięśniowej niezbędny jest trening z niskim RIR (np. 0-4 RIR). Zapewnia to, że pracujesz wystarczająco blisko swojej maksymalnej pojemności, aby skutecznie stymulować wzrost mięśni.',
    'home.scientific.novice.title': 'Dylemat Nowicjusza',
    'home.scientific.novice.1': 'Osoby początkujące i niewytrenowane konsekwentnie zaniżają swoje prawdziwe RIR, co oznacza, że często kończą serie daleko od upadku, pozostawiając na stole znaczące przyrosty mięśni. Badania konsekwentnie pokazują ten wzorzec w różnych populacjach.',
    'home.scientific.novice.2': 'Kluczowa meta-analiza Halperina i in. (2021) oraz podobne badania dowodzą, że nowicjusze często mylnie oceniają RIR o 2-4 powtórzenia, wierząc, że są blisko upadku, podczas gdy mają jeszcze wiele powtórzeń w zapasie. Prowadzi to do nieoptymalnej intensywności treningowej i wolniejszego postępu. Kiedy osoby trenują samodzielnie, często przedwcześnie przerywają serie, znacząco ograniczając swój potencjał wzrostu mięśni.',
    'home.scientific.trainer.title': 'Rola Trenera Personalnego',
    'home.scientific.trainer.1': 'Trener personalny może dokładnie ocenić RIR, zapewnić obiektywną informację zwrotną i bezpiecznie doprowadzić klientów do optymalnej intensywności niezbędnej do wzrostu. Ta obiektywna informacja zwrotna jest nieoceniona dla przyrostu mięśni, ponieważ eliminuje zgadywanie, które często nęka trening prowadzony samodzielnie.',
    'home.scientific.trainer.2': 'Trenerzy zapewniają progresywne przeciążenie i właściwe zastosowanie RIR w różnych ćwiczeniach, dostosowując się do unikalnych możliwości i codziennych wahań wydajności każdego klienta. Ta wiedza jest szczególnie kluczowa dla nowicjuszy, którym brakuje doświadczenia do dokładnego oceniania własnych limitów.',
    'home.scientific.science.title': 'Nauka o RIR a Hipertrofia',
    'home.scientific.science.1': 'Dokładne zastosowanie RIR, ułatwione przez trenera, bezpośrednio przekłada się na znacząco lepszą hipertrofię mięśniową i wyniki siłowe. Dowody naukowe są jasne: trening bliżej upadku (niższe RIR) przynosi lepsze rezultaty.',
    'home.scientific.science.2': 'Meta-regresja opublikowana w Sports Medicine w 2021 roku wykazała, że trening bliżej upadku (niższe RIR) jest bezpośrednio związany z większą hipertrofią mięśni. Chociaż dokładne odsetki różnią się w zależności od osoby, badania te potwierdzają zależność dawka-reakcja między wysiłkiem a przyrostem mięśni. Im bliżej swojego prawdziwego limitu trenujesz, tym większy jest bodziec do wzrostu mięśni.',
    'home.scientific.conclusion': 'Dowody są jasne: praca z wykwalifikowanym trenerem personalnym, który rozumie RIR, może znacząco poprawić Twoje rezultaty budowania masy mięśniowej, zapewniając trening w optymalnej intensywności. Nie zostawiaj swoich zysków na stole - pozwól profesjonaliście poprowadzić Cię do swojego prawdziwego potencjału.',
